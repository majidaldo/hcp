experimental centralization of notebooking

* activate jupyter server through the wrapper from (not going into the conda environment)
* have to have ipykernel installed in the devenv
* use jupytext to pair notebook with a text file: File->jupytext. That will get into source control. Notebooks will not be saved to source. Enforced with [jupytext.yml](../.jupytext.yaml).
